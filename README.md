# CVSS-TE: Threat-Enhanced Vulnerability Scoring System

Thank you to the original author of the tool [cvss-bt](https://github.com/t0sche/cvss-bt) 

## Overview

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an industry standard for assessing the severity of security vulnerabilities. While the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides CVSS Base scores, these alone are insufficient for effective vulnerability prioritization. 

This repository enhances vulnerability scoring through two complementary approaches:

1. **CVSS-BT (Base + Temporal)**: Enriches standard CVSS scores by incorporating the Exploit Code Maturity/Exploitability (E) Temporal Metric using the official CVSS specification.
2. **CVSS-TE (Threat-Enhanced)**: An advanced scoring system that extends beyond CVSS-BT by incorporating detailed exploit quality metrics and additional threat intelligence context.

## CVSS-BT Scoring Logic

### Temporal Metric - Exploit Code Maturity/Exploitability (E)

The CVSS-BT score incorporates the Exploit Code Maturity/Exploitability (E) Temporal Metric based on available threat intelligence. This metric uses a prioritized decision tree to categorize vulnerabilities:

| Value | Description | Assigned When |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Attacked (A)** (CVSS 4.0) | Vulnerability has verified attacks in the wild or widely available exploit solutions | ‚Ä¢ Found in CISA KEV or VulnCheck KEV<br>‚Ä¢ EPSS score ‚â• 0.36<br>‚Ä¢ Has Metasploit module (for CVSS 4.0) |
| **High (H)** (CVSS 2.0/3.0/3.1) | Functional autonomous code exists with reliable exploitation | ‚Ä¢ Found in CISA KEV or VulnCheck KEV<br>‚Ä¢ EPSS score ‚â• 0.36<br>‚Ä¢ High-quality Metasploit module (quality score ‚â• 0.8) |
| **Functional (F)** (CVSS 2.0/3.0/3.1) | Functional exploit code is available that works in most situations | ‚Ä¢ Has Metasploit module (quality score < 0.8)<br>‚Ä¢ Has Nuclei template<br>‚Ä¢ Multiple high-quality PoCs (quality score ‚â• 0.8 with multiple sources) |
| **Proof-of-Concept (P)** (CVSS 3.0/3.1/4.0) | Proof-of-concept exploit code is available but may not work in all situations | ‚Ä¢ Found in ExploitDB<br>‚Ä¢ Has GitHub PoC |
| **Unproven (U)** / **Unreported (U)** | No exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical | ‚Ä¢ Not present in any of the above threat intelligence sources |

### EPSS Threshold Explanation

The EPSS threshold of 0.36 (36%) is based on the F1 score of the EPSS v3 model. At approximately 37%, a CVE is highly likely to have weaponized exploit code available. This threshold is used as a signal for the "High" or "Attacked" exploit maturity designations.

## CVSS-TE Scoring Logic

The CVSS-TE score builds upon the CVSS-BT approach by incorporating additional dimensions:

1. **Base CVSS-BT Score**: Starting with the temporal score that already accounts for exploit maturity
2. **Exploit Quality Metrics**: Assessing the reliability, ease of use, and effectiveness of available exploits
3. **Threat Intelligence Context**: Incorporating additional threat landscape factors

### Exploit Quality Assessment

Each exploit source is evaluated based on three key metrics:

| Source | Reliability | Ease of Use | Effectiveness |
|--------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Metasploit | 0.9 | 0.8 | 0.85 |
| ExploitDB | 0.7 | 0.6 | 0.7 |
| Nuclei | 0.8 | 0.9 | 0.75 |
| GitHub PoC | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.6 |
| CISA KEV | 0.95 | 0.7 | 0.9 |
| VulnCheck KEV | 0.9 | 0.7 | 0.85 |

For Metasploit exploits, we further refine the reliability rating by incorporating the actual reliability and rank information from the module metadata when available.

The overall quality score is calculated as a weighted average:
- Reliability (40% weight)
- Ease of Use (30% weight)
- Effectiveness (30% weight)

### CVSS-TE Calculation

The CVSS-TE score is calculated using the following formula:

```
CVSS-TE = min(10, CVSS-BT_Score * Quality_Multiplier + Threat_Intel_Factor)
```

Where:

**Quality Multiplier**: Ranges from 0.8-1.2 based on exploit quality
- For poor quality exploits: closer to 0.8 (reducing the base severity)
- For high quality exploits: up to 1.2 (increasing the base severity)
- Formula: 0.8 + (quality_score * 0.4)
- If no exploits exist: defaults to 1.0 (neutral impact)

**Threat Intel Factor**: Adds 0-2 points based on additional threat intelligence
- CISA KEV or VulnCheck KEV presence: +1.0
- High EPSS score (‚â• 0.5): +0.5
- Moderate EPSS score (‚â• 0.36): +0.25
- Multiple exploit sources (‚â• 3): +0.5
- Two exploit sources: +0.25
- No threat intelligence signals: +0.0 (no automatic increase)

### CVSS-TE Severity Levels

| CVSS-TE Score | Severity Level |
|---------------|----------------|
| 9.0 - 10.0 | CRITICAL |
| 7.0 - 8.9 | HIGH |
| 4.0 - 6.9 | MEDIUM |
| 0.1 - 3.9 | LOW |
| 0.0 | NONE |

## Default Behavior When No Threat Intelligence Exists

When a vulnerability has no data from any external threat intelligence sources:

**For CVSS-BT**:
- The Exploit Code Maturity value defaults to "Unproven" (E:U) or "Unreported" (E:U) for CVSS 4.0
- This typically results in a temporal score that is lower than the base score
- For CVSS 3.0/3.1, an E:U value applies a multiplier of 0.91 to the base score
- For CVSS 4.0, an E:U value applies a similar reduction

**For CVSS-TE**:
- The Quality Multiplier defaults to 1.0 (neutral, as there are no exploits to evaluate)
- The Threat Intel Factor is 0.0 (no intelligence signals to consider)
- The resulting CVSS-TE score equals the CVSS-BT score: `CVSS-TE = CVSS-BT * 1.0 + 0.0 = CVSS-BT`

## Practical Application

A key benefit of CVSS-TE is its ability to reduce noise in vulnerability management by providing more accurate threat context:

1. **Reduces False Positives**: Vulnerabilities with high base scores but no exploits in the wild are appropriately downgraded
2. **Highlights True Threats**: Vulnerabilities actively being exploited are properly prioritized
3. **Contextualizes Vulnerability Feeds**: Helps security teams filter through overwhelming CVE volumes

## Example Interpretations

### Example 1: Reducing Noise
**CVE with Base Score 9.1**
- CVSS-BT Score: 7.3 (High)
- CVSS-TE Score: 6.8 (Medium)
- Demonstrates downgrading of vulnerabilities with limited exploitation evidence

### Example 2: Highlighting True Threats
**CVE with Base Score 7.5**
- CVSS-BT Score: 6.5 (Medium)
- CVSS-TE Score: 8.3 (High)
- Shows elevation of scores for vulnerabilities with high-quality exploits and active threats

### Example 3: Clarifying Risk Levels
**CVE with Base Score 5.5**
- CVSS-BT Score: 5.5 (Medium)
- CVSS-TE Score: 7.8 (High)
- Highlights vulnerabilities with significant real-world threat potential

## Caveats and Considerations

- CVSS-TE is a custom approach to vulnerability prioritization
- Exploit quality metrics are based on empirical observations
- Scores should be considered alongside other contextual factors
